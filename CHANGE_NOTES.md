# Change Notes

### v1.01
- Fix scrolling not keeping up when navigating within configurations using keyboard.
- Display message dialog if configuration can't be executed in run / debug mode - instead of trying to run it.
- Use IntelliJ CommonShortcuts to retrieve shortcuts for Find action. Use those shortcuts to go to lookup component. If those are not defined, then use Ctrl + F as a basic shortcut.
